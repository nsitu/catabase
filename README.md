Catabase - Social Platform

Catabase is a simple social sharing website powered by a MySQL database. It aims to demonstrate a boilerplate social media web app with a relational database, persisting users, posts, friendships, messages, and likes. It includes a basic onboarding / signup mechanism, content posting with image file uploads, user profile editing, a Like button, a friendship mechanism, and messaging options.

Backend: PHP and MySQL / Frontend: HTML CSS Bootstrap and JQuery

This code was developed by Harold Sikkema and serves as support material for Integrated Systems Design at Sheridan College.
